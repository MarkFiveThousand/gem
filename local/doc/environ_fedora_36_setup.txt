# Fedora 36 Installation Notes
#
# Install the Fedora operating system in either a standalone box, or install
# Oracle VirtualBox on Windows, then install Fedora in the virtual machine.
# =============================================================================



# =============================================================================
# To Do
# =============================================================================
# For Mark.  Everyone else may ignore this.
#
# What is the default path for linux?  In the instructions for setting/getting
# the selinux state, the commands are in the /usr/sbin folder.  That is not in
# my path.  The online documentation shows calling the commands including the
# path.  Should we add /usr/sbin to our path?  Is it already there?  In
# gem_bash_init, where we set the path, we should document the default Fedora
# path.  Update the selinux appendix as appropriate.


# =============================================================================
# Next Time
# =============================================================================
# At some point during configuration, logging out then back in results in the
# task bar not showing up upon login.  Rebooting restores the task bar.
#
# Determine which change is causing this.

# Preface
# =============================================================================
#
# Fedora Linux is an advanced development branch of the commercially used Red
# Hat Enterprise Linux.  Red Hat first releases leading edge packages into the
# Fedora development line, then later merges them into Red Hat Enterprise
# Linux.  Fedora is deemed stable.  Beta releases of Fedora, containing the
# newest beta package releases, are also available.  We're sticking with the
# latest stable release of Fedora in this guide.
#
# This guide covers installing Fedora Linux, LXQt Edition.  LXQt Edition is
# geared towards low resource PCs.  We're favoring it for it's light weight and
# speed.  Other variations of Fedora, called "spins", are also available at
# https://spins.fedoraproject.org.
#

# Official Fedora Documentation:
# ------------------------------
# The official documentation appears to be undergoing changes.  The document
# linked to below is incomplete.

#
# More complete documentation can be found at the Fedora wiki link below.
# Enter terms related to what you're looking for.  Pay attention to the dates
# on articles.  Much old material is present-- some still relevant, some not.

#
#
# Using this Document
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE: Some parts of this document may be old and out dated, and may refer to
# commands that are now deprecated, though hopefully those have all been
# removed or updated.
#
# *TODO: Move the following block to the terminal installation instructions.
#
# Throughout this document lists of commands are given.  They may be copied
# from this document by selecting the text, copying using ctrl-c, then pasting
# into a command terminal by middle-clicking in the terminal window.  Double-
# clicking on text selects a block of text delineated by spaces.
#
# Super User Commands
# -------------------
#
# Many commands are prefaced with "sudo".  Sudo is short for "super user do".
# Super user is a user with administrator rights, typically a user named
# "root", also known as administrator of the computer.  We'll give our user the
# right to execute a subset of commands as administrator by adding our user to
# the /etc/sudoers file.  More on that later.
#
# A user may also execute commands as administer by temporarily assuming the
# identity of root user by entering the "su" command, pressing Enter, followed
# by entering the administrator password.  The command "exit" will return the
# user to their own identity.  Wherever you see "su" within a block of
# commands, you must enter root's password from the keyboard before proceeding
# with the commands that follow.


# Linux Commands:
# ---------------
# *TODO: Provide a basic tutorial for navigating the file system from the
# command line.
#
# It is expected readers of this document will take it upon themselves to learn
# linux commands on their own, as instruction of such is beyond the scope of
# this document.  It is recommended that readers new to Linux keep a
# reference handy for looking up commands as needed:

# =========================
# Installation Instructions
# =========================
# We support two options for installing fedora linux.
#
# Option 1: Installing Fedora in VirtualBox running inside of Windows
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
## You do not need a bootable CD/DVD/USB.  VirtualBox can read the .iso file
# directly as a virtual optical (CD/DVD) ROM drive.  Proceed to the section
# titled "Download Fedora Linux, LXQt Edition."  You may proceed with the
# downloaded .iso file.
#
# Option 2: Installing Fedora on a standalone system
# --------------------------------------------------
## You will need to create bootable installation media.  We have several options
# for creating boot media from which to install Fedora.  Jump to the
# appropriate section further below.
#
# a.) Create a bootable CD Within Fedora
# b.) Create a bootable USB Within Fedora
# c.) Create a bootable USB Within Windows



# =============================================================================
# Download Fedora Linux, LXQt Edition                    Last updated: 6/7/2021
# =============================================================================

# Navigate to https://spins.fedoraproject.org/en/lxqt/.
#
# Scroll down and click "Download Now."  At the next page, click "Download."
# Your download will begin.  No need to worry about verifying the download
# after downloading it.  That will be done much more easily during the install
# process.
#
# If you're installing Fedora in a virtual machine, the .iso file you just
# downloaded will be your bootable media.  Proceed to the section titled
# "Create a Virtual Machine."


# =============================================================================
# Create a bootable CD Within Fedora              Last updated: Before 6/7/2021
# =============================================================================
# NOTE: At the time of upgrading to Fedora 34, these instructions were not
# reviewed for continued correctness.  Update reviewing, please note the date
# of last review.

# If you're running Fedora in a standalone device, as opposed to a virtual
# machine, then jump to the section titled Install Brasero CD Burning
# Application.  Otherwise, you're running Fedora in a virtual machine.  The
# next couple of steps must be performed in Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager with
# the virtual machine *not* running.
#
# First, you may need to eject the guest addition CD, that may still be in the
# virtual CD drive from when we initially installed the currently running
# version of Fedora.

# In Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager, select your virtual machine in the left
# pane, then click Settings at the top.  In the left pane click Storage.  In
# the Storage Devices panel, below Controller: IDE, select the blue circle.  To
# the far right, under Attributes, where it says "Optical Drive:", click on the
# blue circle, then Remove Disk from Virtual Drive.

# Now we're going to map the virtual CD drive to the physical one in the host
# machine.  In the Storage Devices panel, below Controller: IDE, select the
# blue circle, again.  To the far right, under Attributes, where it says
# "Optical Drive:", click on the blue circle, then select Host Drive 'D:', or
# whatever your CD drive is called.  Check the passthrough box.  When checked,
# the guest is allowed to send ATAPI commands directly to the host-drive which
# makes it possible to use CD/DVD writers connected to the host inside the VM.
#
# Click Ok, then start the VM.


# Install Brasero CD Burning Application:

sudo dnf install -y brasero

# Run brasero.  Fedora->Sound & Video->Brasero

# Click Select a disc image to write.  Navigate to your downloaded fedora .iso.
# Your CD/DVD writer should be listed under Select a disc to write to.  Click
# Burn.

# We're going to use Fedora's Media Writer tool to create a bootable USB, as
# documented at:
#
# https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f32/install-guide/install/Preparing_for_Installation/


# If you're not running in a VM, you may skip this step.  On the menu bar
# choose Devices->USB.  Then select your USB drive.  This is like plugging it
# into the VM.  It should show up under /run/media/$USER/.
# E.g.: /run/media/mhodges/6DBE-FA41.


# Install Media Writer:

sudo dnf install -y mediawriter

# Run Media Writer:  Fedora->System Tools->Fedora Media Writer


# At the top-right, verify that Intel 64bit is selected.  This is most likely
# the kind of computer you have.
#
# If you have already downloaded the LXQt .iso file, click Custom image.
# Navigate to your downloaded .iso file.
#
# If you have *not* yet downloaded the LXQt .iso file, click the three dots at
# the bottom to display a list of the Fedora Spins available.  Select "Fedora
# LXQt Desktop 32", then click "Create Live USB..."

# The Write Custom Image dialog should be displayed.  Your USB drive should be
# visible, or else selectable.  Click Write to Disk.

# Create a Virtual Machine                                Last Updated 6/7/2021
# =============================================================================
# If you are installing Fedora on a standalone system, skip ahead to the
# section titled Install Fedora Linux.
#
# VirtualBox, made by Oracle, allows various operating systems to run
# concurrently within other operating systems using virtualization.  We're
# going to create a virtual machine to run Fedora Linux inside of Windows.
#
# Download and install VirtualBox for Windows Hosts from:
# https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
#
# After installing it, consider pinning a shortcut to
# C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VirtualBox.exe to the Windows taskbar for
# easy launching.
#
# Launch C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VirtualBox.exe, Oracle VM
# VirtualBox Manager using the pinned shortcut.
#
# Go to Machine->New, to create a new virtual machine.  Assign it a name.  I
# use naming scheme like "f36v1" for Fedora 36 version 1.  I occasionally will
# create more than one virtual machine for experimental purposes.  Choose a
# name to your liking.
#
# Note the Machine Folder field.  This is where your virtual machine files are
# stored on your local hard drive.  Among these files is your virtual hard
# drive, a .vdi file.
#
# Choose Type: Linux
#
# Choose Version: Fedora (64-bit)
#
# Choose a memory size that is in the green region.  I choose half of my actual
# system memory size.  Memory handed over to your virtual machine will be
# unavailable to Windows while the virtual machine is running .  Giving too
# much memory to your virtual machine will cause Windows to perform very
# poorly.  The amount of memory allocated can be easily changed later.
#
# Under "Hard disk", leave "Create a virtual hard disk now" selected.
#
# At any time during this process, you may select the "Guided Mode" button at
# the bottom for further information about the selections we will be making.
# This guide is walking you through "Expert Mode".
#
# Click "Create."

# ON the next dialog box, under "Hard disk file type", leave VDI (VirtualBox
# Disk Image) selected.
#
# Under "Storage on physical hard disk", leave "Dynamically allocated"
# selected.  This permits the virtual hard disk to grow up to the selected
# size.  It will begin at a minimal size.  I'm specifying a 300 GB hard drive,
# but the actual starting size will be about 8 GB following a fresh install and
# update.  The drive will grow up to the maximum size specified.  If you're
# tight on space and you only intend to play with fedora a bit, then creating a
# 20 GB hard drive may be sufficient.
#
# Click "Create."

# In the "Create Virtual Hard Disk" dialog box, choose a hard drive size.
#
# I'm creating a 300 GB hard drive for large software projects.  The remainder
# of this tutorial expects that you've chosen to create a 300 GB virtual hard
# drive.  You may choose to create a hard drive of a different size.
#
# Under Hard disk file type, you should leave VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)
# selected.  Under Storage on physical hard disk, leave Dynamically allocated.
# Even though we're requested a 300 GB drive, the space will be allocated as
# needed rather than all at once.
#
# Click Create.


# =============================================================================
# Configure Our Virtual Machine
# =============================================================================
# We will install the Fedora Linux operating system in a moment.  First, we
# need to change some settings for our virtual machine.  Deep integration of
# the Fedora Linux operating system with Windows is provided by a system called
# Guest Additions.
#
# In "Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager", with our new virtual machine selected in
# the left panel, click "Settings" on the tool bar at the top.
#
# In the left panel, select "General".  In the right panel, click the
# "Advanced" tab.  Change "Shared Clipboard" to "Bidirectional".  Change
# "Drag'n'Drop" to "Bidirectional."
#
# In the left panel, select "System".  In the right panel, select the Processor
# tab.  Notice how many processors will be allocated for the virtual machine.
# The number available will depend on the number of cores available in the
# processor running in your actual machine.  Select a value in the green area,
# keeping in mind, like system RAM, these resources will be exclusively
# available to the virtual machine, and therefore not to Windows.  As such,
# allocating too many processors to the virtual machine may adversely affect
# the performance of your Windows machine.  This setting, like RAM, can be
# changed at any point while the virtual machine is powered down.
#
# In the left panel, select "Display".  In the right panel, click the Screen
# tab.  Next to "Acceleration", check "Enable 3D Acceleration."  WARNING!  I
# have run into stability problems with VirtualBox crashing and menus not
# drawing correctly.  Disabling 3D acceleration fixed these issues.  Enable
# it with caution.  You can always come back here to disable it, if you're
# encountering weird display issues.
#
# In the left panel, select "Storage".  In the right panel, below "Controller:
# IDE", Click "Empty."  This is how we insert a CD image (.iso file) into the
# virtual machine's CD/DVD drive.  Click the blue circular icon to the right of
# "IDE Secondary Device 0."  Select "Choose a disk file..."  Navigate to and
# select your downloaded .iso file.  It will likely be wherever your downloaded
# internet files are located.  Mine is named Fedora-LXQt-Live-x86_64-36-1.5.iso.
# Yours may have a different version number. Select your file and click Open.
# When the dialog box is dismissed, check the "Live CD/DVD" checkbox.
#
# In the left panel, select "Network".  In the right panel, change "Attached
# to:" to "Bridged Adapter."  "Name:" refers to your network device that you
# would like to use to connect to your network.  This will likely be your PC's
# WiFi adapter.
#
# Note that while the host PC may be using a wireless WiFi connection, this
# will be presented to the virtual machine as a wired ethernet connection.
#
# In the left panel, select "USB".  In the right panel, select USB 3.0.  Under
# "USB Device Filters", click the second rightmost blue icon (the one with the
# green plus).  If you have any USB devices that you would like to be visible
# to Fedora (other than your keyboard or mouse), select them.  I select my
# android phone here for software development within the fedora environment.
# You likely have nothing to enable, here.  However, if you need to access a
# USB flash drive from Linux, you will need to select that device here to allow
# it to be seen from within the virtual machine.
#
# Click "OK"


# =============================================================================
# Configure Optional File Sharing between Windows and Linux
#
# *TODO: Move this section into gem\local\doc\environ_network.txt.
#
# Note, if you're just installing Fedora to play around with it, you may not
# need to share files between Windows and Linux.  However, when you begin
# doing any substantial work in Linux, you will likely want to come back here
# to enable easy file sharing between linux and Windows.
# =============================================================================
#
# We're going to notify Oracle VirtualBox VM Manager of which Windows folders
# we would like to share with Fedora. If, at this point, you're not sure which
# folders to share, that's fine.  You don't need to share any folders at this
# time.  You can skip this section. We can share folders at any point in the
# future.
#
# Open settings for your virtual machine in Oracle VirtualBox VM Manager.  In
# the left panel, select "Shared Folders".  In the right panel, click the
# blue folder icon (the one with the green plus).  Under "Folder Path:", select
# "Other..."  Select a folder that you would like to make available/share with
# Fedora.
#
# As I have multiple development environments available (i.e. windows, wsl,
# fedora, msys, & cygwin), I share my user /home/$USER folder between each.  I
# create the following shared folders:
#
# In this section, you'll need to know the host name of your Windows pc.  To
# find out what your pc's host name is, open a Windows command prompt by
# entering "cmd" into the search box below the Windows start menu.  When the
# command terminal opens, enter the "hostname" command.  My host name is
# "mars".  Anywhere you see "mars" in the below commands, you'll need to
# replace with your own pc's host name.
#
# Do not check the Read-only or Auto-mount boxes.
#
# Folder Path: C:\
# Folder Name: mars_root
# Mount point: /home/mhodges/gem/home/mhodges/mnt/mars_root
#
# Folder Path: \\wsl$\fedora\home\mhodges
# Folder Name: mars_wsl_mhodges
# Mount point: /home/mhodges/gem/home/mhodges/mnt/mars_wsl_mhodges
#
# Folder Path: C:\msys64\home\mhodges
# Folder Name: mars_msys64_mhodges
# Mount point: /home/mhodges/gem/home/mhodges/mnt/mars_msys64_mhodges
#
# Folder Path: C:\cygwin64\home\mhodges
# Folder Name: mars_cygwin_mhodges
# Mount point: /home/mhodges/gem/home/mhodges/mnt/mars_cygwin_mhodges
#
# Note: These folders will not be available until we later install Guest
# Additions.
#
# Click "OK."

# Now your virtual machine is configured with the Fedora installation .iso file
# (disk) inserted into the virtual optical drive.  We're ready boot the virtual
# machine and install Fedora.  Advance to the section titled First Boot to
# Install the Fedora OS.



# =============================================================================
# First Boot to Install the Fedora OS
# =============================================================================
#
# Now your virtual machine is ready to be run!  This section is for the very
# first time you are booting Fedora.
#
# The name of your new virtual machine should be shown in the left panel in
# Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager.  Mine shows as, "f36v1."
#
# Select it then click "Start" on the menu bar at the top.
#
# If you have already inserted the .iso disk file into the virtual optical
# drive, as instructed in an earlier step, then you may skip ahead to the
# section titled Install Fedora Linux further below.
#
# If you do not have an .iso disk file inserted into the virtual machine's
# optical device, then you will be presented with a different menu when you
# boot.  Continue reading.
#
# Upon first launch, you may see the "Select start-up disk" dialog box with the
# following text:
#
#     "Please select a virtual optical disk file or a physical optical drive
#     containing a disk to start your new virtual machine from.
#
#     The disk should be suitable for starting a computer from and should
#     contain the operating system you with to install on the virtual machine
#     if you want to do that now.  The disk will be ejected from the virtual
#     drive automatically next time you switch the virtual machine off, but you
#     can also do this yourself if needed using the Devices menu."
#
# Click "Cancel."
#
#
# Get Ready!  You're going to have to take action quickly!
#
# The start up screen will show for about 2 seconds displaying the message
# "Press F12 to select boot device" near the lower right corner.  It's very
# easy to miss.  If you take no action, the message, "FATAL: No bootable medium
# found! System halted."  This almost certainly did/will happen on your first
# try.
#
# To try again, reboot the virtual device.  On the file menu, go to
# Machine->Reset.  This time, Press F12 before the start up screen disappears.
# You get about 2 seconds!  You may have to try a couple times.
#
# This will leave you at a screen where you must select where you bootable
# media is.  You likely want to navigate to where your downloaded fedora .iso
# file is located.
# =============================================================================




# =============================================================================
# Install Fedora Linux
# =============================================================================
#
# *TODO: Update for installing directly to device, rather than in Virtual Box.
#
# Note: The LXQt version of Fedora, being the low resource version, initially
# looks rather ugly.  We will be updating many user interface elements.  It
# will look and feel much different and more comfortable than the current
# default configuration.

# Before we embark upon the following steps, it's important to remember that we
# are configuring a machine that we defined with the VirtualBox Manager.  If we
# are unsatisfied with anything that we're about to attempt, that is fine.  You
# may reattempt installing the operating system as many times as you like.
# Simply exit back out the the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager, then delete the
# virtual machine you just created, and start over again.  Be aware that the
# virtual machine's files, including the hard drive are stored under
# C:\Users\mhodges\VirtualBox VMs, for user mhodges.  Of course, you will
# replace mhodges with your own Windows login.

# Boot from the installation .iso file.  You may have to press f12 to change
# the boot device to CD/DVD or USB.  You should see a short menu with an option
# to "Test this media & start Fedora-LXQt-Live 34"  Press enter to test the
# media and run the installer.
# 
# When the desktop shows up, several notifications will be shown.  It is safe
# to ignore these.  You may also see a message similar to the following:

# "VirtualBox Guest Additions update available!  Your virtual machine is
# currently running the Guest Additions version 6.1.18.  Since you are running
# a version of Guest Additions provided by the operating system you installed
# in the virtual machine we recommend that you update it to at least version
# 6.1.26 using that system's update features, or alternatively that you remove
# this version and then install the Oracle Guest Additions package using the
# install option from the Devices menu.  Please consult the documentation for
# the operating system you are running to find out how to update or remove the
# current Guest Additions package." This message is safe to ignore.  We will
# address guest additions in a moment.
#
# Begin the Installation
# ----------------------
#  1.) When the desktop shows up, double-click the "Install to Hard Drive"
#      icon.  A message box will appear displaying the message, "This file
#      'Install to Hard Drive' seems to be a desktop entry.  What do you want
#      to do with it?"  Click Execute.  It may take several seconds for the
#      installer, called Anaconda Installer, to launch.
#
#  2.) Click "Continue" to move past the Language selection menu.
#
#  3.) Click "Time & Date."  Verify the Time & Date are set correctly for your
#      time zone.  At the upper left corner, click "Done."
#
#  4.) Click on "Installation Destination."
#
#  5.) Near the bottom of the Installation Destination screen, under "Storage
#      Configuration", select Custom.  Near the top of the screen, verify the
#      drive that you would like to install to is checked, then click Done at
#      the top-left.
#
#  6.) This step likely won't apply to most people.  If you previously had
#      Fedora installed on this hard drive, which is likely not the case,
#      select all previous Fedora partitions, then delete (-) button at the
#      bottom.
#
#      NOTE: When I click Done, at the bottom of the screen I get the message,
#      "Error checking storage configuration.  Click for details or press Done
#      again to continue." Clicking for details gives the message, "Failed to
#      find a suitable stage1 device: EFI System Partition cannot be of type
#      ext4.; EFI system Partition must be mounted on one of /boot/efi.; EFI
#      System Partition cannot be of type lvmpv."  This may have been a result
#      of installing on an already partitioned drive.  If you run into this,
#      at the Installation Destination screen, for Storage Configuration,
#      select Advanced Custom (Blivet-GUI).  Delete any preexisting
#      partitions, then switch back to Custom
#
#  7.) You should now be in the Manual Partitioning screen.  Under "New Fedora
#      36 Installation", and under "New mount points will use the following
#      partitioning scheme:", change to LVM.

#  8.) Click the "Click here to create them automatically" link above the
#      previous one.
#
#  9.) The "fedora_localhost-live" prefix is uncomfortably long, so we are
#      going to shorten it to just "fedora."  To the right, under "Volume
#      Group:" and under "fedora_localhost-live", click the "Modify" button and
#      rename it to simply "fedora". Click Save.

# 10.) Adjust Volume Sizes
#
#      If you just want to play around with Linux and don't intend to
#      do hardcore software development, then you don't need to change the
#      size of volumes as described below at all.
#
#      *TODO: Instruct what to click on in this above case.  Just click Done,
#             then Accept Changes?

#      For our purposes here, we may consider a volume to be a special file
#      folder.  We're going to distribute our hard drive space among two
#      volumes, one for operating system files and another for our user files.
#      Keeping the two spaces separate allows higher security settings to be
#      set for the operating system files.

#      The storage sizes we are about to set here assume that you earlier
#      created a virtual hard disk of the same size that I did, 300 GB.  It's
#      okay to enter sizes that you feel are more appropriate to your needs.
#      If you have a hard drive larger than 300 GB, then you would likely
#      allocate your additional space to your /home volume for your own usage.
#
#      Applications that need to be installed and accessible to all users would
#      appropriately be installed at the SYSTEM or operating system level in
#      fedora-root, also referred to with just / in the file tree, where
#      operating system files go, rather than at the user level.
#
#      We will install our software development applications in the
#      /home/$USER/ folder.
#
#      Your user will be granted super user privileges. This means you will be
#      able to perform many system administration operations by assuming
#      identity "super user", i.e. using the "su" command.  We'll discuss that
#      in more depth further below.
#
#      Notice, almost the entire 300 GiB space has automatically been
#      allocated.  In the lower left, I see TOTAL SPACE 300 GiB and AVAILABLE
#      SPACE 1023 KiB.  There's always going to be a little space available
#      that cannot actually be used for various reasons.  While allocating
#      space we want to keep the "Available Space" number as small as possible,
#      by the time we've finished our reapportionment, since this will be
#      wasted unusable space.

#      The upper left of this screen shows the virtual hard drive is going to
#      be divided into a DATA portion and a SYSTEM portion.  The SYSTEM portion
#      contains the operating system files.  We will be installing the
#      operating system in the SYSTEM portion of our virtual hard drive next.
#      These Operating system files are located topmost in the file tree, at
#      the root file path /.  The DATA portion of our virtual hard drive will
#      contain all our user home directory and files.  That's where we do all
#      our work.

#      Our files located in /home/$USER/ reside within or under the root
#      folder.  We will give our user privileges to freely modify files within
#      their /home/$USER/ folder.
#
#      The SYSTEM portion also contains additional storage media, like the
#      fedora install media we booted from.
#
#      The hard disk that we renamed "fedora" from "fedora_localhost-live", has
#      been divided into 3 sections called volumes.  These are named 1.)
#      fedora-home, located in the DATA section in the folder titled /home.
#      All your personal files will reside here in /home/$USER. 2.) fedora-root,
#      located in the topmost folder /.  This is where the operating system
#      files will be installed.  There is no folder titled "fedora-root".
#      Rather, the OS files will be located in a collection of folders all
#      located under root /, and be siblings of /home.  3.) sda1 located in
#      /boot is the .iso file/CD/DVD/USB drive you inserted and booted from to
#      install Fedora, assuming you have not yet removed it.
#
#      The way you booted this time is unusual because we are booting from an
#      alternate media to install the OS onto the hard drive.  Typical boots
#      will be from the OS we are currently installing onto the hard drive.
#      Sda1, sda2, sdb1, or sdb2 is the internal name of the .iso file/CD/DVD/
#      USB drive you inserted and booted from this time.  These drives are
#      located and accessible in the file tree.  These folders where drives are
#      mounted are called mount points (E.g. /, /home, /mnt/, and /boot).
#
#      In the left pane, click "fedora-root."  In the right pane, change
#      "Desired Capacity" from "70 GiB", or whatever yours is, to "20 GiB".
#      This shrinks the amount of space available to the OS.  We're shifting 50
#      GiB of available space from the OS to our /home/$USER directory.  This
#      will leave about 8-9 GB to install additional packages beyond our
#      minimal set of OS packages.
#
#      If you know you are going to be installing additional packages to be
#      used by the operating system or to be available to all users, it would
#      be appropriate to allocate more of your available hard drive space here.
#      For our case, we are not describing an installation for a multi-user
#      system, so we're shifting free space from the OS to our own user
#      account.

#      In the left pane, click "fedora-home".

#      Notice, whatever space you made available by shrinking the fedora-root
#      volume, will show up as available in the pink box at the lower-left
#      portion of the screen titled "AVAILABLE SPACE".  Mine shows 50 GiB
#      because I shrunk my fedora-root partition from 70 GiB to 20 GiB.

#      In the right pane, under "Desired Capacity", increase the size to
#      consume the space we made available when we shrank the fedora-root
#      partition.  I changed my /home Desired Capacity from 229 GiB to 279 GiB.
#      To update all the values, after changing the "Desired Capacity", click
#      another partition (e.g. fedora-root), then back to fedora-home to
#      update "AVAILABLE SPACE."

#      I was able to grow my fedora-home to 279 GiB on a 300 GiB VM.  Remember,
#      if you're installing on a virtual machine rather than a standalone box,
#      300 GiB ws the maximum the drive will grow to.  It does not start off
#      that size.  I had 1023 KiB remaining that I was unable to allocate to
#      any partition.  Click the "Done" button at the upper left.

#      In the "Summary of Changes" dialog box, click "Accept Changes."  You
#      will be returned to the "Installation Summary" screen.
#
# 11.) Click "Root Account."  Root is the name of the administrator.  Select
#      "Enable root account." Set a root/administrator password.  Write it down
#      and do not forget it!.  Click "Done."  You will be returned to the
#      "Installation Summary" screen.
#
# 12.) In the "Installation Summary" screen, click "User Creation".  Enter your
#      first and last name.  A user name will be automatically generated
#      consisting of your first initial immediately followed by your last name.
#      You may change it if you prefer to have a different user name.
#
#      Uncheck "Add administrative privileges to this user account (wheel group
#      membership).
#
#      Enter a password, then click "Done."
#
# 13.) After returning to the "Installation Summary" screen, click "Begin
#      Installation."  When configuration is complete, click "Finish
#      Installation."
#
#      To shutdown Fedora click the blue icon in the lower left corner of the
#      desktop.  This is the equivalent of the Windows start menu.  
#
#      Click "Leave", then "Shutdown."  Click "Yes" to agree to shutdown.
#      We'll use the following notation to indicate this and similar menu
#      selections:
#
#      Fedora->Leave->Shutdown.
#
# 14.) VirtualBox only: Before we reboot, we need to remove the installation
#      .iso (disk) in the virtual machine's optical drive.  Return to Oracle VM
#      VirtualBox Manager.  In the left pane, select your virtual machine.
#      Click the "Settings" button on the top.
#
# 15.) VirtualBox only: In the left pane of the settings menu, click "Storage."
#      In the right pane, under "Storage Devices" and "Controller: IDE", click
#      "Fedora-LXQt-Live-x86_64-36-1.5.iso", or your similarly named .iso file.
#
# 16.) VirtualBox only: To the far right, under "Attributes" and to the right
#      of "Optical Drive:", click the blue disk icon, then click "Remove Disk
#      from Virtual Drive."  Click "OK."
#
# 17.) On the button bar at the top of the window, click Start to boot your
#      virtual machine, then log in.  This is our first login to Fedora Linux!

# 18.) NOTE for VirtualBox only: Fedora is connecting to the network via a
#      virtual "wired connection".  However, it is using the host's connection,
#      which may or may not be wired. In any event, Fedora should obtain an
#      internet connection through your host pc.


# 19.) We're going to be cutting and pasting many commands from this document
#      into the command terminal.  That's only a problem if you're installing
#      on a standalone device.  If you're running in virtual box, then can
#      already easily copy and paste from this document, and you may skip this
#      section.
#
#      Since you're installing on a standalone device you're going to need a
#      copy of this file on the device we just installed Linux on.  We're going
#      to email this file to ourselves, sending it from a Windows machine then
#      retrieving it from the same email account on the Linux device.
#
#          Log into Fedora.
#
#          Install Firefox.  To open a command prompt/terminal window, go to
#          Fedora->System Tools->QTerminal, or type ctrl-alt-t.  Enter the "su"
#          command below to become super user (i.e. root/administrator),
#          followed by root's password.  Then enter the following command:
#
#          (Remember, in Linux you can copy the line from this document and
#          paste it into the terminal windows using the middle mouse button.)
#
#          Copy and paste the below command into the command terminal:
#
#          dnf install -y firefox
#
#          Run Firefox: Fedora->Internet->Firefox.  This may be a good time to
#          set your Firefox preferences.  In settings, I choose "Restore
#          previous session" and "Ctrl+Tab cycles through tabs in recently used
#          order."
#
#          Log into your email.  email this document to yourself, so you have
#          it on the new Fedora installation.  When that is done, you can copy
#          commands from this document and paste them into the terminal window
#          to save a lot of typing.
#
#
#      While viewing this document in the default text editor, Enki, you may
#      find it easier to view by turning off line wrapping.  I get an error
#      dialog displaying when I open the following menu.  It's safe to ignore
#      and click through it.
#
#      a.) Settings->Settings.  In the left panels, click Editor->Long Lines,
#          and uncheck "Wrap long lines".
#
#      b.) In the left panel click, Editor->Font.  In the right panel click
#          "Change font...".  Select 10 under "Change size", then click "OK"



# 20.) Open a command prompt/terminal window.  From the Fedora desktop, open:
#
#          Fedora->System Tools->QTerminal, or type ctrl-alt-t.
#
#      Most of the work will be performed in this command terminal.  We will be
#      replacing this one with a better one shortly.  You will always need to
#      have one of these open.


#20.a.) Speed up the dnf package manager by allowing for parallel downloads.
#
#      Copy and paste the commands below into the command terminal.  In linux
#      use the middle mouse button to paste.  After pasting, press enter to
#      execute the commands in the command terminal.  You may have to enter
#      your password for root/administrator.  That's always the case when
#      running the 'su' command to temporarily assume the identity of 'super
#      user', which is root, which is the administrator account.  'exit'
#      returns the user to their own account.

su
echo "max_parallel_downloads=10" >> /etc/dnf/dnf.conf
exit


# 21.) Many updates have likely been released since the downloaded .iso
#      installation disk was created, so we'll now update the OS.  Open a
#      command prompt terminal window.  Go to Fedora->System Tools->QTerminal.
#      Enter the "su" command below to become super user (i.e. root/
#      administrator), followed by root's password.

#       NOTE: After entering root's password, you may copy the below lines to
#             the clipboard using ctrl-c, then paste them into the terminal
#             window using ctrl- shift-v or by clicking the middle mouse
#             button.  Later we will be installing a different terminal to
#             replace QTerminal with a more user-friendly one.

su
# Enter root/administrator password.


dnf -y update
dnf -y update kernel*
dnf -y install kernel-devel* elfutils-libelf-devel

# Restart Fedora:
#
# Fedora->Leave->Reboot





# How much hard drive space is being used?  Let's find out.  Open a terminal
# and enter the below command:
#
# Fedora->System Tools->QTerminal, or ctrl-alt-t.

df

# I get the below output on a virtual box device made with a 300 GB virtual

# The entries of interest are:
#
# /dev/mapper/fedora-root      This is where the operating system and installed
#                              applications are stored.
#
# /dev/mapper/fedora-home      This is our personal hard drive space.  As
#                              software we create and files we store are kept
#                              here, we have allocated the greatest amount of
#                              space here.

# We selected a virtual hard drive (.vdi file) that will dynamically grow up to
# the maximum size we specified when we create the virtual machine.
#
# Now let's see how much space Windows says we're using.  In Windows, navigate
# to: C:\Users\<Windows user name>\VirtualBox VMs\<your virtualbox machine
# name>
#
# Mine is here:
#
# C:\Users\mhodges\VirtualBox VMs\f36v1
#
# Windows shows our virtual hard drive (mine: f36v1.vdi) is actually occupying
# about 7 GB in Windows.  Note: If you want to back up your virtual machine's
# hard drive, this is the file to store.
#
# Next, we're going to make the virtual machine a more comfortable place to
# work.


# =============================================================================
# Closing a Virtual Machine
# =============================================================================
# When you close the VirtualBox window without properly shutting down the
# operating system, you are presented with the "Close Virtual Machine" dialog
# box.
#
# Save the machine state- is a lot like putting the virtual machine to sleep.
# A virtual machine's entire internal state can be saved at any time.  This
# includes the complete state of memory and the hard drive.  This can consume
# an enormous amount of hard disk space, but can be useful if you need to
# restore your machine to an earlier state.  Doing so is beyond the scope of
# this lesson, and is not applicable to our needs at this point.
#
# Send the shutdown signal- This notifies the OS to begin the shutdown process.
# It is effectively the same as telling the OS to shut down via the start menu.
#
# "Power off the machine"- Should only be used if the OS has become
# unresponsive.  It's equivalent to pulling the plug.  System state may not be
# saved and the OS could be left in a corrupt state.





# =============================================================================
# Install VirtualBox Guest Additions (Deprecated- skip)
# =============================================================================
# Source: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html
#
# VirtualBox Guest Additions allow tighter integration between the Windows and
# Linux operating systems.  It allows us to share files, copy and paste
# between Windows and Linux applications and more.  Since this is now managed
# automatically we may skip this section.  It has been left here as guest
# addition versions may fall out of sync with Oracle Virtual Box updates.  In
# which case we may need to modify the guest addition installation manually.
#
#  1.) The beauty of an open source operating system is we are going to run a
#      script that will compile the changes into the Fedora operating system
#      kernel.
#
#      Click on "Devices" on the Oracle VM VirtualBox menu bar at the very top.
#      At the bottom of the menu, select "Insert Guest Additions CD image..."
#      This will insert the virtual CD into the virtual CD drive.  When the
#      "Removable medium is inserted" dialog appears, click "Open in file
#      manager", then click "OK."  The file manager (Fedora->Accessories->
#      PCMandFM-Qt File Manager) will open.  We will customize the appearance
#      of the file manager later.
#
#      If you have previously inserted the Guest Additions CD and you need to
#      launch the installation script again, find on the bar at the bottom-
#      right of the Fedora desktop a button to the left of the volume icon.
#      Hover the mouse over it to display the message "Removable media/ devices
#      manager."  Left-clicking it displays a message similar to
#      "VBox_GA_6.1.34."  Click the message to open the Guest Additions CD
#      again.
#
#  2.) Find and double click autorun.sh.  When the "Execute file" dialog
#      appears, click "Execute in Terminal"  Enter root administrator's
#      password.
#
#      ALTERNATIVELY: If you are updating guest additions, the shell may not
#      execute properly.  I may not have changed the terminal program within
#      the os properly.  I need to look into that.  That's okay.  Do the
#      following:
#
#      a.) Open a terminal
#      b.) Become super user: su
#      c.) cd /run/media/${USER}/VBox_GAs_         <DON'T PRESS ENTER YET!>

#          ...then press the tab key.  Pressing the tab key will prompt the
#          terminal to complete the file name if the file name is unique.  If
#          more than one file name satisfies the request to complete, then the
#          file name will be completed up until the first difference.
#      e.) Run: ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
#
#
#      When prompted, "Do you wish to continue? [yes/no], type y, then enter.
#
#      When the kernel has been rebuilt, complete the installation by pressing
#      enter to close the terminal.  Close all currently running applications
#      and restart to run the new kernel.
#
#      Fedora->Leave->Reboot

# After logging in, verify Guest Additions are working by resizing the window.
# The desktop should resize accordingly.
#
#  3.) On the bar at the bottom-right of the Fedora desktop there's a button to
#      the left of the volume icon.  Hover the mouse over it to display the
#      message "Removable media/devices manager."  Left-clicking it displays
#      a message similar to "VBox_GA_6.1.34."  To the right is the eject
#      triangle.  Click the triangle to eject the Guest Additions CD.
#
# Next, we will continue to make the linux environment more comfortable.







# =============================================================================
# Terminal Settings
# =============================================================================
# We're going to change the text colors in the terminal window.  Open a
# terminal window:
#
# Fedora->System Tools->QTerminal, or ctrl-alt-t.
#
# Copy and paste (ctrl-shift-v) the following all the way through EOF into the
# terminal window:

cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.bak

# Set gem_hostname to your desired name for your system.  To view your current

hostnamectl

# My hostname is "localhost-live.hsd1.ca.comcast.net".  Your hostname shows up
# under "Transient hostname."

# Become root to make the change.

su


# In the /etc/hostname file we're going to replace localhost.localdomain with
# f36v1.localdomain.  Change the f36v1 below to whatever you would like your
# computer name to appear as on the network.

# As stated earlier, I might have multiple installations, so I chose f36v1 for
# my 1st installation of Fedora 36.

# NOTE: The .localdomain suffix is required in the hostname file.  This makes
# it what is called a fully qualified domain name (FQDM).  When it shows up in
# windows, it only shows the first portion.  If you leave off the .localdomain
# suffix Windows will not be able to see the linux machine on the network.


gem_fedora_hostname=f36v1
hostnamectl set-hostname ${gem_fedora_hostname}


# Verify the hostname has changed:

hostnamectl

# Now we see "Transient hostname" has changed to "Static hostname", which now
# shows our new host name.

# LXQt allows the appearance of font, icons, and colors to be changed.
#
# Open Fedora->Accessories->PCManFM-Qt File Manager so we can view the changes

#
# Open: Fedora->Preferences->Appearance.

#     Icons Theme: Pop (A simple and modern icon theme)
#     LXQt Theme: Fedora-lxqt
#     Font->Point size: 12
#     Cursor->Breeze Light
#
# Click "Apply."  Notice how the file manager appearance has changed.
#
# Close the "LXQT Appearance Configuration" window.


# Additional window settings are also available:
#
# Fedora->Preferences->Openbox Settings.  NOTE: This app may be getting

# Appendix C: Firewall Notes
# =============================================================================
# NOTE: These operations can also be performed for the services app in the
# Administration system menu. Enable & disable are permanent.  Start & stop are
# temporary.

# Disable firewalld:
# ------------------
systemctl disable firewalld
systemctl stop firewalld


# Enable firewalld:
# -----------------
systemctl enable firewalld
systemctl start firewalld


# Check if firewalld is running:
# ------------------------------
systemctl status firewalld

# Appendix D: SELinux Notes
# =============================================================================
# Source: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Security-Enhanced_Linux/sect-Security-Enhanced_Linux-Working_with_SELinux-Enabling_and_Disabling_SELinux.html
#
# NOTE: When systems run with SELinux in permissive or disabled mode, users
# have permission to label files incorrectly. Also, files created while SELinux
# is disabled are not labeled. This causes problems when changing to enforcing
# mode. To prevent incorrectly labeled and unlabeled files from causing
# problems, file systems are automatically relabeled when changing from
# disabled mode to permissive or enforcing mode. 


# View the current SELinus label for a given directory:
# ----------------------------------------------------
ls -ldZ /path/to/directory


# Check if selinux is enabled:
# ----------------------------
/usr/sbin/getenforce


# Enable selinux:
# ---------------
/usr/sbin/setenforce 1


# Disable selinux:
# ----------------
/usr/sbin/setenforce 0



# =============================================================================
# Appendix E: Back Up Files
# =============================================================================
#
# In addition to your home directory, below are some directories and files you
# may want to consider backing up.  Which are relavent depends on which
# packages you have installed, configured, and use.
#
# Back up the MySQL (mariadb) databases.  The mysqldump command can be used to
# export a database to a MySql script text file.  The script can later be fed
# back into MySql to restore the databases.  See the gem_archive scripts for
# usage examples.
#
# Samba configuration file:
#
# * /etc/samba/smb.conf
#
# Web development configuration files:
#
# * /etc/php.ini
# * /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
# * /var/www/html/
# * /var/www/ftp/

# Appendix F: Creating a Disk Partion
# =============================================================================
#
# Source: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/creating-a-disk-partition-in-linux/

# List your partitions:

parted -l

# ... shows my 2TB drive as:

Disk /dev/sdb: 2000GB

# Create one large partition on /dev/sdb:

parted -a optimal /dev/sdb mklabel

... (parted) mklabel                                                          
... New disk label type? gpt                                                  
Warning: The existing disk label on /dev/sdh will be destroyed and all data on this disk will be lost. Do you
want to continue?
Yes/No? yes
(parted) mkpart primary ext4 0% 100% << as the folks in this thread suggested

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdh1
/dev/sdh1 alignment is offset by 512 bytes.
This may result in very poor performance, (re)-partitioning suggested.

# Appendix I: NVidia Drivers- Last Updated on Fedora 34, 2021/10/02
# =============================================================================

# *FIX: I'm just still gathering information here.  I have not attempted to
# install any NVidia-specific drivers yet.

# If you have a Nvidia card, run Xorg and the following:

# modinfo -F version nvidia
# sudo dnf update -y # and reboot if you are not on the latest kernel
# sudo dnf install -y akmod-nvidia # rhel/centos users can use kmod-nvidia instead
# sudo dnf install -y xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda #optional for cuda/nvdec/nvenc support
# sudo dnf install -y xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda-libs
# sudo dnf install -y vdpauinfo libva-vdpau-driver libva-utils
# sudo dnf install -y vulkan
# modinfo -F version nvidia
