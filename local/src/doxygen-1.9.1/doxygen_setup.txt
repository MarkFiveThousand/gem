Create a configuration file
---------------------------
Each project gets its own configuration file.  Create a template configuration
file:

doxygen -g <config-file>

If <config-file> is omitted, "Doxyfile" will be used.  The configuration file
has a format that is similar to that of a (simple) Makefile. It consists of a
number of assignments (tags) of the form:

TAGNAME = VALUE or
TAGNAME = VALUE1 VALUE2 ...
